# Phase 1: Production MVP Roadmap

**Project:** Synapse Task Management System
**Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q1 2026 (10-12 weeks)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS üöß

## Overview

Phase 1 transforms the validated UX prototype into a production-ready application with enterprise features.

### What Changed: Prototype ‚Üí Phase 1

| Feature | Prototype (Phase 0) | Phase 1 Production |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Backend** | json-server (mock) | Go + PostgreSQL |
| **Authentication** | Email-only (mock) | JWT + OAuth (Zoho/Keycloak) |
| **Data Storage** | In-memory (db.json) | PostgreSQL with persistence |
| **Task Creation** | GUI only | GUI + Email + Recurring |
| **Access Control** | None | Full RBAC (4 roles) |
| **Email Integration** | ‚ùå Not available | ‚úÖ Zoho Mail + Outlook |
| **Recurring Tasks** | ‚ùå Not available | ‚úÖ Full recurrence patterns |
| **Deployment** | Local dev only | Docker + CI/CD + Staging |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| OAuth integration issues | High | Start early, test thoroughly, have backup plan |
| Email parsing complexity | Medium | Use simple regex for Phase 1, AI for Phase 2 |
| Performance with recurring tasks | Medium | Optimize cron job, use indexes, monitor metrics |
| RBAC implementation time | High | Use existing libraries, start with basic roles |
| Team bandwidth | High | Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-haves |

---

- ‚ùå NLP/AI task extraction
- ‚ùå Document parsing (PDF, DOCX)
- ‚ùå Knowledge graph (Neo4j)
- ‚ùå Analytics dashboard
