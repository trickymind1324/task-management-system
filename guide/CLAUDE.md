**Problem:** People didn't know which to read first, had to read multiple documents

**Solution:** One comprehensive guide with both basics and workflow

**Benefits:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I really need to read the whole guide?

**If you're new to Claude Code or our team:** Yes! It's only 30-45 minutes and will save you days of trial and error.

**If you're experienced:** At minimum, read Part II (our workflow) and the Quick Reference Card.

### Can I just jump to coding?

**No!** Our workflow requires documentation first:
1. Create CLAUDE.md
2. Create FRDs
3. Then start coding

This saves time in the long run.

### What if I forget something?

Use the Quick Reference Card at the end of the ULTIMATE guide. Print it or keep it open in a tab.

### How do I know which FRD to read?

Check `docs/00-INDEX.md` - it's organized by priority and phase.

### What if the guide doesn't cover my situation?

1. Check troubleshooting section
2. Ask in team channel
3. Document the solution (update the guide!)
