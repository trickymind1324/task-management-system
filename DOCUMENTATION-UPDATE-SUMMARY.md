# Documentation Update Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Reason:** Clarify Phase 1 requirements - prototype becomes Phase 0, production MVP is Phase 1

---

## What Changed

### Key Insight
The prototype with mock APIs was **Phase 0** (UX validation), not Phase 1.
**Phase 1** is the production MVP with real backend, email integration, recurring tasks, and RBAC.

## Impact on Current Work

### Frontend Migration
**Current Status:** Phase 1 foundation complete
- âœ… Authentication system
- âœ… API client
- âœ… Zustand stores
- âœ… Dashboard layout
- âœ… Login page

**Next Steps:**
- Complete task management components
- Add email integration UI
- Add recurring task UI
- Add role-based UI elements

### Backend Development
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** High - start immediately after frontend task components

**First Tasks:**
1. Set up Go project structure
2. Configure PostgreSQL database
3. Implement core API endpoints
4. Add JWT authentication
5. Deploy to Docker container

---

## Timeline Impact

### Original Understanding
- Phase 1: Prototype â†’ 2 weeks âœ… DONE
- Phase 2: Production backend â†’ TBD

### Updated Understanding
- Phase 0: Prototype â†’ 2 weeks âœ… DONE
- Phase 1: Production MVP â†’ 10-12 weeks ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
  - Includes backend, email, recurring tasks, RBAC
  - Includes infrastructure and deployment

**Net Change:** Phase 1 is now much larger and includes enterprise features that were previously undefined.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Prototype = Phase 0**, not Phase 1
   - Purpose was UX validation only
   - All features were mocked

2. **Phase 1 = Production MVP** with:
   - Real backend (Go + PostgreSQL)
   - Email integration (core business requirement)
   - Recurring tasks (common user request)
   - RBAC with OAuth (enterprise requirement)

3. **AI features moved to Phase 2**
   - NLP, document parsing, knowledge graph
   - Not needed for initial launch
   - Can be added after core features proven

4. **Clear scope for Phase 1**
   - All requirements documented
   - Timeline estimated (10-12 weeks)
   - Success criteria defined
   - Risks identified

## Questions for Sunny

1. **Email Integration Priority:**
   - Should we start with Gmail or Outlook first?
   - Are there specific email parsing requirements beyond basic extraction?

2. **RBAC Provider:**
   - Primary choice: Zoho or Keycloak?
   - Do we need both or can we start with one?

3. **Recurring Tasks:**
   - Are there specific recurrence patterns beyond standard (daily/weekly/monthly)?
   - Should we support exceptions (skip one occurrence)?

4. **Infrastructure:**
   - Preferred cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure)?
   - Self-hosted or managed services?

5. **Timeline:**
   - Is 10-12 weeks acceptable for Phase 1?
   - Any hard deadlines or milestones?
